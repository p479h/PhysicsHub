<!--This is the basic setup to start writting simulations.
Notice how I made the background of the canvas dark form
stylistic preference.

The canvas below will be accessible from within js. Hence
we will be able to draw anything we want.-->

			<h2>Canvas transformations</h2>
			<p>Here I will discuss only one thing. Canvas transforms. Again.</p>
			<p>This time I will show implementation of transforms in a more organized
				manner.</p>
			<h3>How will canvas transforms affect our drawing?</h3>
			<p>It is importatnt to analyze this point carefully. You see,
			so far we have made many choices when coding that relied on the
			normal field of view for the canvas. But changing it may break the
			simulation. For example:</p>
			<p>	The balls bounce off walls, which are defined by the canvas
			height and width. Changing the transforms will lead to weird effects.</p>
			<p>Check below what happens to our simulation when we change the scaling
			of our coordinate system (i.e. when we zoom in). Also note that
			for application of these transforms I am working in another js file called
			transforms.js</p>

			<p>The same is true for rotation and translation, but of course, it
			the problem should be clear from the example.
			In the next html document we will discuss how to solve this issue.
