    <h1>Inellastic collisions</h1>
    <p>
      This is the most common kind of collision. This is what you see when
      you let a very soft object hitting another object. Energy gets dissipated
      in many forms. This energy was kinetic energy of the colliding object.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although very important, the problem with this kind of collision is that
      it is very difficult to predict collision behaviour when collisions are
      innelastic. The reason being that the exact ammount of energy that
      gets lost in the collision will vary widely with colliding material and
      other conditions such as pressure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before closing this section however, I want to reinforce one thing. So far,
      no human has ever observed any collision disobey the law of conservation
      of momentum. The reason? Nobody really knows. But if you respect
      conservation of momentum, and if your algebra is sharp, you will always
      make right predictions about velocities of objects before
      and after the collision. If you want to know more about conservation of
      momentum. Read the next section. It introduces ellastic collisions with
      conservation of momentum.
    </p>
    <h1>Ellastic collisions</h1>
    <p>
      Ellastic collisions are collisions where not only the momentum but also
      the total kinetic energy of the colliding bodies is conserved.
      That means that if two or more objects that collide ellastically are
      left without external influences, they will never speed down. Their
      speeds may vary with time. But the total kinetic energy and momentum
      of the system will be conserved.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a fundamental property of the universe that albeit not obeyed
      by large objects, is regorously obeyed by atoms. These have never
      been observed to collide innelastically. This sould ring a bell in your
      head right now!!! The universe is a bag of atoms. Which we know to collide
      ellastically, hence energy is conserved within the universe. But if the total
      energy content of the universe is fixed, where did the amount that is already
      here come from? Hopefully you also want to know the answer to this question.
      Every physicist does. To get closer to the answer, it may help to try and
      predict the behaviour of objects that collide ellastically like atoms.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first concept that one needs to understand in this section is conservation
      of momentum. The law of conservation of momentum states that the sums of
      the products of mass and velocities of objects in a closed system shall not
      change. In leimans terms, if you leave a bunch of objects in a box in vacuum
      and no external forces like asteroids act on the box, the total momentum of the
      box and its contents will not change. The momentum being the sum of the velocities
      multiplied by the masses of each object inside and including the box.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mathematically, momentum is described as $$P = mv$$, where \(P\) is the momentum,
       \(m\) the mass and \(v\) the velocity of the object.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note however, that this definition indicates that the direction of the velocity
      matters. This is what makes velocity different than speed. Velocity contains
      information about the direction of movement. Now you should be asking yourself.
      If two people can interpret the same velocity differently because they are
      in different places (maybe they are looking at the same object from different)
      sides. How does one know what is the correct sign of the velocity?
    </p>
    <p>
      Short answer, one does not have to. What one
      can do, and this works in practice, is take the velocities of
      both objects relative to one another or another object. If they are
      travelling in oposite directions, they have oposite signs for their velocities.
    </p>
    <p>
      The animation below shows this with two balls with the same mass and
      exactly the same speed. But in oposite directions. What do you think is the
      total momentum of the system?
    </p>
    <!-- <svg>
      Here we write SVGCODE
    </svg> -->
    <p>
      Furthermore, you were told (and if you perform your own experiments you
      may confirm), that the momentum in a closed system does not change.
      This is interesting. Because in a situation like the one above, you
      can find out information about the speeds or masses of the balls depending
      on what information you are given using conservation of momentum!!! But
      before showing you how, I will write down the mathematical description
      of conservation of momentum. Which reads that the sum of momentums before
      a collision is equal to the sum of momentums after the collision.
      $$\sum{P_i} = \sum{P_f} $$
    </p>
    <p>
      THis is valid for all directions simultaneously!!! This is the best part.
      Therefore, this can be written using vector notation:
      $$\sum{P_i} = \sum{P_f} $$
    </p>
    <p>
      With this in mind, lets go back to the situation where we had two balls
      with equal masses and velocities. Lets give them the names \( b_1\) and \( b_2\),
      for the balls on the left and on the right respectively. \( b_2\) has a mass
      that is twice as high as that of \( b_1\), which has a mass \( m_1\). The speed
      before the collision is the same for both balls. If the heavier ball (\( b_2\)) loses half of
      its speed. How fast must the other ball be going after the collision?
    </p>
    <p>
      Lets write what we know:
      $$\sum{P_i} = \sum{P_f} $$
      $$\sum{P_i} = m_1v_1+m_2v_2$$
      $$\sum{P_f} = m_1\frac{v_1}{2}+m_2v_?$$
      $$v_1 = -v_2$$
    </p>
    <p>
      Now you just have to use algebra to isolate the unknown term:
      v_? = \frac{m_1v_1+m_2v_2 - m_1\frac{v_1}{2}}{m_2}
      Which can be simplified by using:
      $$v_1 = -v_2$$
      $$m_1 = -\frac{1}{2}m_2$$
      I didnt write this on paper. So it coulr be wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, what if we could find the velocities of BOTH colliding objects after
      the collision, knowing only their values before the collision?
      This can be done for ellastic collisions and this is the reason.
      If you have \(n\) variables you do not know, you need \(n\) hints about
      each varaible's identities to find out the value of each one. This translates
      into us needing \(n\) equations to find \(n\) variables in those equations.
      For ellastic collisions we have in general 2 equations:
      $$\sum{P_i} = \sum{P_f} $$
      and $$\sum{K_i} = \sum{K_f} $$
      Where \(K_i\) and \(K_f\) are the initial and final kinetic energies of
      the objects involved in the collision. With this in mind it might be obvious
      why ellastic collisions are so nice. But I will make it extra clear:
    </p>
    <p>
      Since for every ellastic collision between two objects the two equations
      above are true, and since these formulas only have 4 variables, you only
      need two of these 4 to find the missing 2!!! This is extremely useful in
      some fields. Now, how do we put this in practice?
    </p>
    <p>
      We just set up the equations. It is a very mathematical kind of
      problem. It really is just algebra. But lets take this a step
      further with the most common use to understanding ellastic collisions:
      Knowing the final velocities of two objects after they collide. So let us
      try to understand a problem like this. First we set up a very general case:
    </p>
    <p>
      We have two balls which we designate the numbers 1 and 2 for. Furthermore,
      the subscripts \(i\) and \(f\) will be used to indicate initial/final conditions,
      hence before and after the collision respectively. Hence for the problem set up we know:
      $$ m_1, m_2, v_{1, i} and v_{2,i}$$
      $$ P_i = P_f $$
      $$ P_i = m_1v_{1, i}+ m_2v_{2, i}$$
      $$ P_f = m_1v_{1, f}+ m_2v_{2, f}$$
      $$ K_i = K_f $$
      $$ K_i = frac{1}{2}m_1_{1, i}^2 + frac{1}{2}m_1_{2, i}^2 $$
      $$ K_f = frac{1}{2}m_1_{1, f}^2 + frac{1}{2}m_1_{2, f}^2 $$
      and we wish to find:
      $$v_{1, f} and v_{2,f}$$
      After a LOT of algebra, you will find the following result:
      $$ v_{1, f} = \frac{m_1-m_2}{m_1+m_2}v_{1, i} - \frac{2m_2}{m_1+m_2}v_{2, i}$$
      $$ v_{2, f} = \frac{m_2-m_1}{m_1+m_2}v_{2, i} - \frac{2m_1}{m_1+m_2}v_{1, i}$$
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, you have a very cool set of equations that help you obtain the final
      speeds of balls that collide head on along some direction. What about
      balls travelling in different directions?
      It is very simple. Just get the part of the velocity that is going torwards
      each ball. This way you will still be getting a "head on" collision. Like
      in the animation below:

    </p>
    <!-- <svg>

    </svg> -->
    <p>
      This can be done by making use of the dot product!!! But as much as I would
      like teaching this topic. I think 3blue1Brown already did it very well. Hence
      I recommend his video for learning the dot product. But to end this explanation
      section, I wish to explain how the dot product fits into this.
    </p>
    <p>
      If both bodies have known velocities, these can be represented as vectors.
      If we represent both vectors in the same coordinate system, the component
      of this velocity can be readily calculated by multiplying the speed along
      the desired direction by the cosine of the angle between this desired
      direction and the velocity. Then, you will get a speed that is the part
      of your velocity that goes in the desired direction. This can be used in
      the formulas above, and the final velocities can again be broken down into
      components of your choosing. Usually, but not restricted to, along x, y, and z.
