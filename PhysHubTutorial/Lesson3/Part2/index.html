<!--This is the basic setup to start writting simulations.
Notice how I made the background of the canvas dark form
stylistic preference.

The canvas below will be accessible from within js. Hence
we will be able to draw anything we want.-->
<html>
	<head>
		<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"></link>
	</head>
	<body>
		<div class="simContainer">
			<canvas id="canvas" height="500px" width="500px"></canvas>
		</div>
		<p>So, how do you like having a solid FOUNDATION?
			From now on you can just keep  adding fancy things
		to the simulation like these trickster colors of mine.

		In the next tutorial, since we have a solid foundation,
		we will decorate the html page.
