YAY, the last text file!!!

From now on, since we will show nice html skills,
we won't be needing this anymore.
So, the layout I thought of was 3 sections. One on top
with some funny name on it. Like a thin rectangle.
Another box in the center. THis one shall hold the canvas.
Finally, another box for content!
This is box is where you will find the next instructions
