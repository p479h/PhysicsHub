<!--This is the basic setup to start writting simulations.
Notice how I made the background of the canvas dark form
stylistic preference.

The canvas below will be accessible from within js. Hence
we will be able to draw anything we want.-->

			<h2>Canvas transformations and simulation integrity</h2>
			<p>You see, the problems we had in the last simualtion were
			due to the fact that many things in the simulation are done
		  using the 4 corners of the untransformed canvas as a reference.</p>
			<p>Therefore, it should be obvious that one way to solve this issue
			would be to use the current canvas transform as a reference to determine
			the coordinates of the new corners of the viewport. If this was not
			obvious, it is ok, I have experience. You are still getting it. But I
			still want you to understand how simple this solution really is.
			We were using the points (0,0) ... (canvas.width, canvas.height) as the
			reference of the corners. We will still do it, but we will undo what the
			transformation matrix did, to obtain the original points in the new coordinates.</p>

			<h2>How do we do that? GOOGLE!!!</h2>
			<p>After 5 min of research I figured out that we can get the
			matrices of the canvas with `ctx.getTransform()`. Which returns
			a 3x3 matix. WHhich has an inverse that is complicated so just visit
			this link: <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/MatrixInverse.html">HERE</a></p>
			<p>Also look<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10892267/html5-canvas-transformation-algorithm-finding-object-coordinates-after-applyin"> HERE</a></p>
			<p>Since this will probably take a while: I have hard coded the inverser:</p>
			<div class="codeHolder">
				<pre>
					const canvas = document.getElementById("canvas");
					const ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");
					function invertCoordinates(x, y){
						const t = ctx.getTransform(); //transform
						const M = t.a*t.d-t.b*t.c;//Factor that shows a lot
						const xnew = (x*t.d-y*t.c+t.c*t.f-t.d*t.e)/M;
						const ynew = (x*t.b+y*t.a+t.b*t.e-t.a*t.f)/M;
						return [xnew, ynew];
					};
				</pre>
			</div>
			<p>With that out of the way, I have done the following modifications on the
			code of the simulation.
			<p>
				First I have created an object called universe.
				This holds the coordinates of the edges of the canvas.
				These will be updated every time the canvas is transformed.
				These will be used as a reference instead of the origin and
				canvas.height and canvas.width. Look the result below!

				Notice two things however. Applying this solution is not everything one,
				would like to do. It is not perfect. If you apply a rotation to this
				for example, it will break. Also, as you proabably noticed, objects
				disappear when there is no space for them in the canvas or when it
				shrinks too fast. This happens because two bodies do not like to stay
				in the same place. But that is what happens when you shrink the universe
				too quickly. More on the next one. We are ready to start thinking about
				a grid.
